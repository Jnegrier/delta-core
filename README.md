Next generation reporting tool where results from all kind all tests are displayed in real time

## The goals of this project are:

- Monitor in real time all the automated tests involved on a software development flow

- Offer image comparison service to be used with visual regression tools

- Keep an history of the results on previous deployments

- Automated comparison with older results to suggest type of failure (application change, test to be updated, platform issue)
